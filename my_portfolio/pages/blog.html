		<h1>This Amazing Flower</h1>
		<p><img src="../images/africaniris.png" width="200" height="200" alt="african lily"/><span style="font-family: alkaline, sans-serif; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 500;">Over spring break I was on vacation in Charleston, and I saw this pretty-looking flower, so I took a picture of it.</span> When I looked it up, I found out that it was called an "African iris", which is native to Southern Africa. These flowers are also called fortnight lilies, and, true to their name, the flowers only last for a few days.</p>
		<p>The African iris is in a family known as "Iridaceae", which includes flowers such as the African cornlily, tiger-flower, baboon flower, and the grasswidow. The Iridaceae family is split into four subfamilies, however DNA analysis suggests that more should be added.</p>

		<h1>Basic Bee Plushie</h1>
		<p><img src="../images/basicbeeplush.png" alt="plushie of basic bee" width="200" height="135" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: alkaline, sans-serif; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 500;">So I was at Target because my mom needed to buy a present for a kid, and when we went into the toy section I saw this box that had a couple of Bee Swarm Simulator plushies.</span> They had a single Vicious Bee plushie, and two plushies of Basic Bee. I really love Basic Bee, so I pointed it out to my mom, and she said I could buy it if I had the money.</p>
	    <p>Unfortunately, I had not brought my wallet with me, so I didn't have the money on me to buy it. Next time I go to Target with my wallet though, if I see another box like this I'm definitely going to buy the plush. I'm obsessed with plushies, and sleep with several at night.</p>

		<h1>Lilly In Her Crate</h1>
		<p><img src="../images/lilly.png" width="200" height="250" alt="dog in a crate holding a toy"/><span style="font-family: alkaline, sans-serif; font-size: 20pt; font-weight: 500;">Me and my family were eating lunch at the kitchen table.</span> When I eat food at home, I like to look around the house from my seat(typically because the TV is on and I want to see it). So as I was looking, I spot my dog, Lilly, in her crate, and see that she's holding one of her toys in her mouth in a weird way.</p>
	    <p>So I point this out to my parents, and take a picture of it because it looks silly. She stayed like that the entire time we were eating lunch and I'm pretty sure she dropped her toy in her crate when someone went to go let her out of the crate. In any case, this is still a very silly picture.</p>
